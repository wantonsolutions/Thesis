\noindent Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for
writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve
his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and
often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a
good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.

simply typeset it and hope it is accepted. It is, however, optional
and may be omitted.

of memory systems, the scalability of memory and the bottle neck of recent memory systems. Second I
will discuss networking technologies like RDMA and provide the background on why it's a

disaggregation and the fundemental challenges that come with writing software for such an

\chapter{Conclusion}

\chapter{ Example Figures and such for formatting reference}
This demonstrates how OGS wants figures and tables formatted. For
figures, the caption goes below the figure and ``Figure'' is in bold.
See Figure~\ref{fig:zen}. Tables are formatted with the caption above
the table. See Table~\ref{tab:bad}.

Of course, Table~\ref{tab:bad} looks horrible. It should probably be
formatted like Table~\ref{tab:good} instead.

For facing caption pages, see Table~\ref{tab:facing}. Of course,
facing caption pages are vaguely ridiculous and my implementation of
them in the class file is by far the most brittle part of the
implementation. It's entirely possible that something has changed and
these don't work at all. I implemented it merely for the challenge.
