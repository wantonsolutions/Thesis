\begin{acknowledgements}

I would like to acknowledged my advisor Alex C. Snoeren for his dedication to his craft and guidance
over the past 6 years. No piece of work within this thesis would be possible without your
collaboration. I would also like to thank my committee members Amy Ousterhout, Yiying Zhang, and
George Papen for their feedback and guidance, and Shrikanth Kandula for his mentorship during my
time at MSR.

This thesis has been extraordinarily influenced by Anil Yelam, my closest collaborator. Thank you
for all the time you spent working on our collaborations, and the hours spent discussing and
debating system designs and performance results. I'm forever grateful. To Maxwell Bland, your
research energy is unmatched and without your help we would never have have acquired any SmartNICs.
And Alex (Enze) Liu for his superior knowledge of Python and unmatched focus on research.  Thank you
to all of the members of the Systems and Networking group at UCSD, especially the optical networking
group for your feedback and guidance during the first years of my PhD.

Thank you to Meta for funding my research and providing me with the opportunity to work on resource
disaggregation, Cavium for the generous donation of two SmartNICs, and to ARPAe for funding my first
years of research.

I'd like to thank all of the members of 3140 for their collaboration and friendship over the years.
It's truly the best office, Chez bob volunteers for keeping me fed, and to my friends for the
support. Camille Rubel thanks for having the best climbing schedule in the world, Phillip Arndt for
pushing my limits, and Camille Moore for keeping me on my toes.

\begin{dissertationabstract} 
%%	
Resource disaggregation proposes a next-generation architecture for data center resources. System
components like compute, memory, storage, and accelerators are separated from one another by a fast
network and composed dynamically into virtual servers when required. This paradigm promises
dramatically improved resource utilization, scalability, and flexibility, but introduces dramatic
challenges in terms of performance and fault tolerance. Memory is among the most difficult resources
to disaggregate. CPUs currently expect DRAM to ultra low latency, high bandwidth, and to share it's
failure domain. In particular increased latency from network round trips dramatically shifts the
performance of existing shared data structures designed for local DRAM.
%%
In this thesis I explore the challenges of sharing disaggregated memory with hundreds of CPU cores.
First in \sword I present a system which utilizes a centralized programmable switch to cache data
structure state and dramatically improve key-value workload performance. Second I present a new
key-value store RCuckoo which is designed to leverage RDMA and reduce round trips when accessed by
CPU's over a network. Finally I present Black Box Disaggregation, a system which enables arbitrary
data structures to be easily ported to the disaggregated setting.

\chapter{Conclusion}

\chapter{ Example Figures and such for formatting reference}
This demonstrates how OGS wants figures and tables formatted. For
figures, the caption goes below the figure and ``Figure'' is in bold.
See Figure~\ref{fig:zen}. Tables are formatted with the caption above
the table. See Table~\ref{tab:bad}.

Of course, Table~\ref{tab:bad} looks horrible. It should probably be
formatted like Table~\ref{tab:good} instead.

For facing caption pages, see Table~\ref{tab:facing}. Of course,
facing caption pages are vaguely ridiculous and my implementation of
them in the class file is by far the most brittle part of the
implementation. It's entirely possible that something has changed and
these don't work at all. I implemented it merely for the challenge.
