%%	
Resource disaggregation proposes a next-generation architecture for data center resources. System
components like compute, memory, storage, and accelerators are separated from one another by a fast
network and composed dynamically into virtual servers when required. This paradigm promises
dramatically improved resource utilization, scalability, and flexibility, but introduces dramatic
challenges in terms of performance and fault tolerance. Memory is among the most difficult resources
to disaggregate. CPUs currently expect DRAM to ultra low latency, high bandwidth, and to share it's
failure domain. In particular increased latency from network round trips dramatically shifts the
performance of existing shared data structures designed for local DRAM.
%%
In this thesis I explore the challenges of sharing disaggregated memory with hundreds of CPU cores.
First in {\sword} I present a system which utilizes a centralized programmable switch to cache data
structure state and dramatically improve key-value workload performance. Second I present a new
key-value store RCuckoo which is designed to leverage RDMA and reduce round trips when accessed by
CPU's over a network. Finally I present Black Box Disaggregation, a system which enables arbitrary
data structures to be easily ported to the disaggregated setting.

\chapter{Background}

Calls for distributed memory systems have been made for decades, and the groundwork of
disaggregation relies heavily on the work of the past~\cite{treadmarks,gms}. However, disaggregation
differs from prior distributed systems due to it's differences in scale, and system assumptions.
It's primary difference is the assumption that each resource be stand alone, and paired with
miniscule or no compute power, save for resources like CPUs an GPUs which are inherently compute.
This assumption transforms the technologies and requirements for disaggregated systems. Critically
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) (or similar CPU bypass technology) is essential in constructing a
passive storage system. Simultaneously in-network line rate processing of user defined functions is
now commonly available in a variety of network devices. The intersection of passive storage,
massively concurrent compute, and programmable networks set a unique landscape for the design of
disaggregated systems.

\section{Disaggregation}

As with many paradigm shifts within the systems community the idea of disaggregation is born from
shifting hardware trends. Per core access to memory has been decreasing for decades. CPU core counts
have consistently increased for over a decade while memory speeds and capacity have improved
comparatively slowly~\todo{cite memory chart}. The result is that CPU cores have less access to
memory now than 10 years ago. Memory is now an increasingly scarce resource and data center
operators are exploring new ways to achieve better memory utilization. Disaggregation is one such
option. Monolithic servers have a fixed amount of RAM per machine which, at a data center level leads
to a skewed distributed of memory utilization. Some servers are starving for memory while others
have gigabytes to spare. This spare (stranded) memory is the target of disaggregation, it aims to
give each server access to a shared pool of RAM. In general a disaggregated resource, be it memory,
FPGA's, or the network itself, can be provisioned for the peak-of-sums, rather than monolithic
resources which are provisioned for the sum-of-peaks~\cite{clio,supernic,dsnf}.

The biggest barrier to disaggregation is network latency, and more aptly the difficulty of
disaggregating a resource is proportional it's access latency with respect to the additional latency
of the network. Disaggregated storage is a foregone conclusion. Academias and industry have pooled
SSD's and HDD's into shared storage pools for their increased capacity and lower cost. This is
relatively easy in comparison to an accelerator, or memory as the access cost of storage is already
high relative to the network. In concrete terms intra rack RDMA ping latencies are on the order of
1-2 us. HDD latencies are 10-20ms and SSD are often 100's of us. In these cases the network overhead
is a single digit percentage or less~\cite{decible}\todo{go back and get more citations}. In
contrast DRAM latencies are 50-100ns. DRAM over RDMA has a nearly 20x overhead compared to local
access. Despite this overhead RDMA is one of the strongest contenders for a disaggregated transport.
CXL is a burgeoning technology which promises NUMA like latencies for remote memory access~\cite{cxl}

\chapter{ Example Figures and such for formatting reference}
This demonstrates how OGS wants figures and tables formatted. For
figures, the caption goes below the figure and ``Figure'' is in bold.
See Figure~\ref{fig:zen}. Tables are formatted with the caption above
the table. See Table~\ref{tab:bad}.

Of course, Table~\ref{tab:bad} looks horrible. It should probably be
formatted like Table~\ref{tab:good} instead.

For facing caption pages, see Table~\ref{tab:facing}. Of course,
facing caption pages are vaguely ridiculous and my implementation of
them in the class file is by far the most brittle part of the
implementation. It's entirely possible that something has changed and
these don't work at all. I implemented it merely for the challenge.
